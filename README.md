# GameOfChance
A simulation based game in NetLogo

The game is a 16-team knockout where one team emerges as the winner in the end.
In this game, firstly you select a number between 0 and 15. The 16 teams play one another in a knockout fashion and only the winner progresses to the next round. 
The teams win at random based on the simulation and if lucky, your team wins.
Winning the game is purely based on luck (and probability), and thus the name, Game of Chance!

Take a look at the screenshots to understand the game better.
